The key goals of the new website are:

        - Improve Mobile Web Experience
        - Increase Bookings

Website statistics show that over 70% of the Web access for the existing site  is by mobile devices. Based on this the website  design us primary a “One Page” with a separate page for the restaurant menu.  This creates a seamless user experiences and minimises load/wait times.


## Use Cases

We have identified 3 major use cases


    - Customer With Booking Intent


        This Use Case represents a customer who knows the restaurant and accesses the website to book a table.  The goal heres is to reduce “friction’ in booking a table.


    - ‘Search” Customer
        
        This represents a customer who is looking for a restaurant to dine in “same day”, they will typically come from Google or Google Maps. 


        The Goals here are to clearly communicate the restaurant brand message and identity and encourage the customer to book.
        
    - Tourist /Trip Advisor
    
        This Use Case represents tourists planning a trip to Dublin, perhaps weeks in advance. They will typically find the restaurant via Trip Advisor. Our primary goal is to encourage/allow the customer book a table, while our secondary goal is to motivate them to join the restaurant mail-list (VIP Club) from where they will receive promotions.
